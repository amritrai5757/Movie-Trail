Used rest api for communication between client(react app) and server(tmdb server) by using routes(given in documentation of tmdb) which triggers corresponding api endpoint functions which gives the specific data required from tmdb database ✨✨

Used async function for having promises and await(inside async) for waiting till the promise returns something ,either fulfilled or rejected. Used axios inside await (aync(await(axios))) for sending request to server by using routes ,which triggers the api endpoint function correspondent to it in server to perform the specific function in database 🤍🤍

Used movie-trailer server to have trailer URL.🤍🤍

Used Context api(hook) to avoid prop drilling(passing data from one part to another by going through several other parts that dont require that data). 

The Data returned by the tmdb server is in json format💙💙
